## Introduction

scTSS is a package that can leverage the 5â€™ single-cell RNA-seq data (both paired-end and single-end data) to study the transcription start site (TSS) at single-cell resolution. scTSS comprises of two main stages, TSS prediction and differential TSS usage (DU) test for TSSs across two or multiple conditions or cell types.
